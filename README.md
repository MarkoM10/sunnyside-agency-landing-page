#Simple landing Page from the Frontend Mentor challenge

Hello everyone :) I've built a simple landing page using HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and SASS. The goal of this project was mainly to improve my CSS skills. This landing page is actually a code challenge from the Frontend Mentor website. The project is not perfect, it needs some responsive improvements but I am thrilled that I achieved pretty much the same design as shown in the challenge.
